Regression models in Python determining the socioeconomic factors impacting "Generosity" within a given country. Through the use of polynomial features, we see there are strong albeit complex relationships between "Generosity" and the independent variables: "GDP per Capita," "Healthy Life Expectancy," "Freedom to Make Life Choices," and "Perceptions of Corruption."

The datasets used are the 2018 and 2019 editions of the World Happiness Report conducted by Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
